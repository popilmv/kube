# kube
We have docker image in Docker hub with go app
Now we apply this in google cloud
In Deploymant we describe numbers o–∞ replica, name and define docker image 
In Service we point our type and ports than we need

To apply this i use command
```
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml && kubectl apply -f my-service.yaml
```
And check information on my cluster IP
```
kubectl get services
```
